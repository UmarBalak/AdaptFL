1. Central Server Component:

Hosts a WebSocket endpoint that clients can connect to
Maintains open connections with all edge devices
Tracks connected clients through their client_ids


2. Edge Device Component:

Initiates connection to server's WebSocket
Sends its client_id for identification
Maintains a persistent connection
When notification received:
* Downloads new weights from Azure Blob
* Updates local model
Auto-reconnects if connection drops
----------------------------------------
-Workflow:
1. Edge device starts up:

Connects to server's WebSocket
Identifies itself with client_id
Starts its training process

2. Server performs aggregation:

Collects weights from Azure Blob
Performs federated averaging
Saves new global weights
Notifies all connected clients

3. Edge devices receive notification:

Download new weights from Azure
Update their local models
Continue training with updated weights
