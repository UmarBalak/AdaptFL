# Task 1:

1. Apne Project ka preprocessing, model training and weight saving code ready hai
2. Sharing, averaging ka bhi ready hai
I know sab basic code hai (usko achha krna hai)
But base to yahi hoga 

So the task is to make the pipeline
Starting from preprocessing to weight saving, yes, not for the averaging.
Which means a pipeline for client only.

And how ?
Mai thoda idea deta hu baki gpt and claude ko bolo wo kr dega
1. Apne ko pure code ko module and package ke form me krna pdega
2. Pura flow banna chahiye

# Task 2: Documentation of code (and not the project)
1. Code me kya kya techniques use kiye hai
2. Preprocessing techniques used for each data type 
3. Which model is used for each data type 
4. One section for Entire workflow 
5. Last but not the least, doc of the pipeline folder that which file contains which code (for development purpose)

Instructions:
1. Do not change the existing code
2. Only work in this folder.
