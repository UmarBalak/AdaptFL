we want end to end step by step implementation worlflow.
like from creating folder to end product.
help me step by step.
start with 1st step.
then after I confirm that the step if done, then go to next step.
to confirm whether the step is done or not, give me some test cases also with step by step guide.



data is is episodes in hdf5.
Each frame is structured as follows:

frame_data = {'frame': frame index,'hlc': high-level command,'light': current traffic light status,'controls': [throttle, steer, brake],'measurements': current speed in km/h,'rgb': rgb camera image,'segmentation': ground truth segmentation image,}
Single HDF5 episode structure:
controls, (x, 3),float64
frame, (x, 1), int64
hlc,  (x, 1), int64
light, (x, 1), int64
measurements, (x, 1), float64
rgb, (x, 200, 288, 3), uint8
segmentation, (x, 200, 288, 3), uint8
